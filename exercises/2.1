1. What is a simple graph?
R:   A simple graph is an undirected graph that has no 
     loops (edges connected at both ends to the same vertex) 
     and no more than one edge between any two different vertices.

2. What is a regular graph? What is a complete graph? Prove that a complete graph is regular.
R:   A regular graph is a graph where each vertex has the same 
     number of neighbours, i.e., every vertex has the same degree 
     or valency. However, complete graphs have the feature that each 
     pair of vertices has an edge connecting them.A complete graph is 
     a regular graph, because each vertex has the same number of 
     adjacencies.

3. What is a path? What is a cycle?
R:   A path is a connection between two graphs. But a cycle is a path
     which starts and end on the same vertice.

4. What is a forest? What is a tree?
R:   A forest is a graph with no cycles. And a tree is a A tree is a 
     connected graph with no cycles.
